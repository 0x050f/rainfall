# rainfall

Rainfall is a 42 project aimed to be an introduction to computer security.
It's composed of several levels under a virtual machine that contains challenges to get the flag for the next level. This is a writeups repo.

Every folder is a level as follow:
```
levelXX/
  flag
  source.c
  walthrough.md
```
`flag` is the flag you have to find on this level and also the password for the next level (`su levelYY`), `source.c` contains the disassembled executable and `walkthrough.md` contains a writeup of the level.
